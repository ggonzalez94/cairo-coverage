## [0.2.0] - 2024-09-17

#### Added

- Support for contracts
- Option to not include macros in coverage report. To get the same behavior as before use `--include macros`
- `--project-path` flag to specify the path to the project root directory. This useful when inference fails 

#### Fixed

- Bug where hit count was not correctly calculated for functions declared at same line
- Functions from imported projects are no longer included in report when `SCARB_CACHE` is set

#### Changed

- `--include-test-functions` was remove in favor of `--include`. To get same behavior as before
  use `--include tests-functions`
- Only the start of the function is now included in the report. The end of the function is optional in the lcov format
  and would produce a warning in tools like `genhtml` when two or more functions are declared on the same line
